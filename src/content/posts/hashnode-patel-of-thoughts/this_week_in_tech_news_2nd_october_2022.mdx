# Akka changes license moves away from Open Source license
It has now adopted BSL license which is a "Source available" license that allows code to be open for developement and non-production usecases such as testing. Other companies using BSL include Senty, Couchbase, CockroachDB and lastly MariaDB(creator of BSL)
This movement from core OSS licenses to less open-source licenses has been happening for quite some time with likes of MongoDB and Elastic switching in the last few years.
