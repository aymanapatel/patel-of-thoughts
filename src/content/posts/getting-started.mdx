Welcome to your new minimal, elegant blog! This post will guide you through the basics of writing content and using the available features.

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in MDX, which means you can use standard Markdown syntax along with React components. All posts live in `src/content/posts/` and include frontmatter metadata at the top.

### Frontmatter Fields

Every post should include:

- **title** (required): The post title
- **description** (required): A brief summary
- **date** (required): Publication date in ISO format
- **tags**: Array of tags for categorization
- **draft**: Set to `true` to hide in production
- **updated**: Optional update date
- **heroImage**: Optional header image URL

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are automatically syntax-highlighted using Shiki. Hover over any code block to see the copy button:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: Date;
  tags: string[];
}

function formatDate(date: Date): string {
  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(date);
}
```

You can use multiple languages:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Calculate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Interactive Components

Since we're using MDX, you can embed React components directly in your posts:

<Demo title="Interactive Counter">
  <InteractiveCounter client:load />
</Demo>

This counter is a fully interactive React component rendered within the post!

## Styling and Typography

The blog uses a comfortable reading width and clean typography. Text is easy on the eyes with proper spacing and hierarchy.

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three with more text to show how it wraps

Ordered lists:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use them to highlight important information or quotes from other sources. They stand out from the regular text with a left border and different styling.
